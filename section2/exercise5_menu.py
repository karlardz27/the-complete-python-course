# Ask the user to choose one of two options:
# if they type 'p', our program should print "Hello" and then ask the user again. Keep repeating this until...
# if they type 'q', our program should terminate.

# Let's begin by asking the user to type either 'p' or 'q'. You know how to do this using input()
# user_input = ...
user_input = input("What do you want to do first? (p) print/ (q) terminate: ")

# Then, begin a while loop that runs for as long as the user doesn't type 'q'.
while user_input != "q":
    # Inside the loop, have an if statement that checks if the user typed 'p'.
    if user_input == "p":
        #    If they did, print "Hello"
        print("Hello")
    # Still inside the loop, ask the user again
    # user_input = ...
    user_input = input("What do you want to do first? (p) print/ (q) terminate: ")
